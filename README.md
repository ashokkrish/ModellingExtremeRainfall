**ModellingExtremeRainfall**

This study analyzes extreme rainfall events in the mining-metallurgical region of NE Chalkidiki, Greece, using data from four meteorological stations recorded between 2006 and 2021. The Maximum Entropy method was applied to estimate the parameters and empirical probabilities of various probability distributions, identifying the optimal fit for accurate risk prediction. Model evaluation was conducted using Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion (AIC).

Results show that the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution provides the best fit for modeling rainfall extremes. The entropy-based approach effectively captures the empirical probability distribution and demonstrates robust performance in modeling extreme rainfall across the stations. These findings highlight key periods of heightened rainfall activity, offering a valuable basis for future risk assessments in the region.
